The project I am working on is a Football Match Planner. Users take on the roles of both club presidents and coaches. Coaches are responsible for ensuring that their clubs have coaches for their teams, and their main task is to schedule matches. A match can be scheduled without renting a field or with the option of renting an artificial turf field (which is highly needed during winter).
The project is not finished yet, but it is gradually approaching completion.
